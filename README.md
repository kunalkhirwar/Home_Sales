**OVERVIEW**

In this challenge, I used my knowledge of SparkSQL to determine key metrics about home sales data. Then used Spark to create temporary views, partition the data, cache and uncache a temporary table, and verified that the table has been uncached.

**OBSERVATION**

The cached runtime is impressively lower than uncached runtime.
